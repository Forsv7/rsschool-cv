## About me

My acquaintance with programming began at school. The solution to simple problems caused delight. What to say about more complex ones.
I studied at the Volgograd State Technical University in the direction of technology and equipment of machine-building industries. At the moment I work at the plant as a design engineer. The programming skills I got during this whole period were useful to me. Recently, I realized that I would like to expand them. That's why I signed up for the Rolling Scopes course.
